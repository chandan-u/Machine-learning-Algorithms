# Machine-Learning Algorithms

This project has various Machine Learning algorithms that haven been implemented from scratch using python and numpy libraries.


## Algorithms

1. Linear Regression(analytical least squares approach)
2. Random Predictor
3. Logistic Regression
4. Logistc Regression with RBF
5. Radial basis Functions
6. Naive Bayes
7. Neural Networks
8. Linear Regression with Gradient Descent(stochaistic)
9. Linear regression with Ridge Regression
10. Linear regression with Lasso Regression



## Data sets
1. SUSY Data set
2. Occupancy-Detection


## Scripts

1. The main script is *scirpt_classify*
2. Algorithms are present in *classalgorithms.py*
3. Data loading/processing scripts are present in *dataloader.py*
4. Common utilities are present in *utilities.py*

## Dependencies

1. python 2.7
2. numpy
3. stat
4. math
